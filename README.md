### Query Parameters
All collections should support the following query parameters (if applicable):

| GET                | POST | DELETE | PATCH |
|--------------------|------|--------|-------|
| abc_def | -    | -      | -     |
| query             | -    | -      | -     |
| ids                | -    | ids    | ids   |
| _names_              | names | names  | names |
| limit              | -    | -      | -     |
| offset             | -    | -      | -     |
| sort               | -    | -      | -     |

so the foo-bar relationship will support foo_names, foo_ids, bar_names, and bar_ids as query parameters to uniquely identify a record.
