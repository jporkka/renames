# Queries1

```powershell
if ($true) { } 
param ([Parameter(p1)] $Thing
# This is a comment
$Thing = New-Thing -Name Thing1 
```

Note that the following code block seems to correctly be powershell
    ```powershell
    if ($true) { } 
    param ([Parameter(p1)] $Thing
    # This is a comment
    $Thing = New-Thing -Name Thing1                      
    ```


Note that the following code block is colored "markdown code"

    ```powershell
    if ($true) { } 
    param ([Parameter(p1)] $Thing
    # This is a comment
    $Thing = New-Thing -Name Thing1                      
    ```

## Queries2
### Query Parameters
~~Strikeout~~ 

All collections should support the following query parameters (if applicable):

| GET                | POST  | DELETE | PATCH |
|--------------------|-------|--------|-------|
| abc_def            | -     | -      | -     |
| query              | -     | -      | -     |
| ids                | -     | ids    | ids   |
| _italic_           | names | names  | names |
| **bold**           | -     | -      | -     |
| ~~Strikeout~~      | -     | -      | -     |
| sort               | -     | -      | -     |

1: Embedded _italic text_ and this **bold text**

2: Embedded _italic_text_ and this **bold**text**

so the foo-bar relationship will support foo_names, foo_ids, bar_names, and bar_ids as query parameters to uniquely identify a record.
